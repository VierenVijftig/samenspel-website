		  <h1>A call to service.</h1>
		  <p>Twenty-first century government needs 21st century thinking and skills.</p>
		  <p>Coders and designers want to make a difference. Leaders in local governments want to innovate. The Code for America Fellowship brings these two groups together for a structured year of building apps, piloting user-centered design and lean startup techniques.</p>
		  <p>The success of the Fellowship is measured not in lines of code, but in sustainable, meaningful change. It's about proving that government can move at the speed of citizens, can speak the language of citizens, and can cost what citizens are willing to pay.</p>
